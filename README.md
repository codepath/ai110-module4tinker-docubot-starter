# DocuBot

DocuBot is a small documentation assistant that helps answer developer questions about a codebase.  
It can operate in three different modes:

1. **Naive LLM mode**  
   Sends the entire documentation corpus to a Gemini model and asks it to answer the question.

2. **Retrieval only mode**  
   Uses a simple indexing and scoring system to retrieve relevant snippets without calling an LLM.

3. **RAG mode (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
   Retrieves relevant snippets, then asks Gemini to answer using only those snippets.

The docs folder contains realistic developer documents (API reference, authentication notes, database notes), but these files are **just text**. They support retrieval experiments and do not require students to set up any backend systems.

## Setup

### 1. Install Python dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

Then edit `.env` to include your Gemini API key:

    ```plaintext
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

If you do not set a Gemini key, you can still run retrieval only mode.

---

## Running DocuBot

Start the program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

Choose a mode:

- **1**: Naive LLM (Gemini reads the full docs)  
- **2**: Retrieval only (no LLM)  
- **3**: RAG (retrieval + Gemini)

You can use built in sample queries or type your own.

---

## Running Retrieval Evaluation (optional)

    ```bash
    python evaluation.py
    ```

This prints simple retrieval hit rates for sample queries.

---

## Modifying the Project

You will primarily work in:

- `docubot.py`  
  Implement or improve the retrieval index, scoring, and snippet selection.

- `llm_client.py`  
  Adjust the prompts and behavior of LLM responses.

- `dataset.py`  
  Add or change sample queries for testing.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Gemini API key for LLM features (only needed for modes 1 and 3)
- No database, no server setup, no external services besides LLM calls
